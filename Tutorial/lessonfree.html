				An image can be just a decorative element. Sometimes, however, it may be the key you are looking for.<br>
				There are many ways to encode password or clues in a picture.<br>
				Image editors, such as free ones on pixlr.com, can help you make <u>adjustments</u> to a picture, such as adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation (nothing too difficult!).<br>
				Not all levels require such editing. You may ignore the photo by default,<br>
				but should you ever feel like you are stuck despite having tried everything, simple image editing might help.<br>
