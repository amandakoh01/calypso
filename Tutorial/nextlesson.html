				Sometimes, the puzzles lie in file extensions, such as ?.jpg, ?.png, ?.avi etc.<br>
				There may be hints in the names of these files. <br>
				Sometimes the error may be obvious, such as a spelling error. Other times, the file name may be a clue.<br>
				Start looking around, and find a file name that you can meddle with. You can replace "nextlesson.html" with the file extension to check it out.<br>
