			You and your friends want to escape from Calypso, a prison on an island.<br>
			Somewhere on this island, you were told that freedom awaits the group that successfully solves the riddles of its four Houses.<br>
			Your informant is a mercenary leader who needs you to create a beacon,<br>
			so that his men can come to your aid.<br><br><br>

			Your group eventually stumbles onto a disused lighthouse,<br>its light dormant and its existence forgotten.<br>You'll need to revive the lighthouse for you to see the paths ahead,<br>and to serve as a rally point for yourselves and the leader's men.<br><br><br>You remember your History teacher telling the class about lighthouses.<br>In the days of old, when GPS and electronic tech are not easily used,<br>lighthouses use various <b>codes</b> to signal incoming boats.<br>
